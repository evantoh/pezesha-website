              Please note, lenders bear the full risk if a loan is not repaid, fully or partially. Pezesha is not lending your money, you are. That said, it is our job at Pezesha to make sure that we stringently assess all borrowers before they are eligible for loans, this ensures repayment, which in turn ensures stable investor returns. We advocate for a prudent risk policy that involves:
              Pre-screening: Before on-boarding a borrower, we conduct thorough checks to determine their capacity to pay. Using our credit-scoring model, we establish the borrower’s credit score and reference third party information from Credit Reference Bureaus.
              Diversification:  We put your eggs in many baskets!!! The Pezesha platform spreads your risk by lending your funds across multiple borrowers.
              Please read our Lender Terms & Conditions before signing up as a lender. If you have any questions about it please contact us directly.

              Pezesha uses a number of ways to ensure that our borrowers are likely to repay their loans. This creditworthiness evaluation is done in real time.<br/>
              1. TransUnion/ CRB to know in seconds whether a borrower has failed to repay loans to any other Kenyan financial institutions in the past<br/>
              2.  Verified and robust data that we access directly from mobile operators’ APIs with their consent (for example, their mobile money statements) to get a very detailed view of their incomings and outgoings, which in turn allows us to understand whether a borrower has the financial capacity to repay your loan<br/>
              3. Strategic partners/trustees also provide us with 12 months consistent stock and automated business transactions of the micro business they work with

              Consumer protection is at the heart of our business for both our borrowers and lenders. 
              With the expertise of our legal arm, we have been able to set clear terms and conditions for our customers including complying with the best international practices over and above that which is required by Kenyan law. 
              We take a collaborative approach in educating our customers on our terms of use and ensuring good user experience in presenting and communicating the terms on our platform.<br/>
              1.Education<br/>
              We understand that the character of a borrower is a key factor in whether the borrower will meet his/her loan obligation.<br/>
              To this end, we spend considerable time in educating the borrower as a means of positively influencing the borrower’s character.<br/>
              Therefore, our loan process starts with educating and creating self-financial awareness to the low income borrowers. This is followed by a clear explanation of the terms and conditions of the loan and how the ability of the borrower to diligently abide by the terms such as timely repayments,<br>
              helps to improve their credit history performance to ultimately connect them to becoming part of the formal financial system.
