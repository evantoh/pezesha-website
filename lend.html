            <div class="panel-body">Consumer protection is at the heart of our business for both our borrowers and lenders. 
            With the expertise of our legal arm, we have been able to set clear terms and conditions for our customers including complying with the best international practices over and above that which is required by Kenyan law. 
            We take a collaborative approach in educating our customers on our terms of use and ensuring good user experience in presenting and communicating the terms on our platform.<br/>
            1.Education<br/>
            We understand that the character of a borrower is a key factor in whether the borrower will meet his/her loan obligation.<br/>
            To this end, we spend considerable time in educating the borrower as a means of positively influencing the borrower’s character.<br/>
            Therefore, our loan process starts with educating and creating self-financial awareness to the low income borrowers. This is followed by a clear explanation of the terms and conditions of the loan and how the ability of the borrower to diligently abide by the terms such as timely repayments,<br>
            helps to improve their credit history performance to ultimately connect them to becoming part of the formal financial system.
