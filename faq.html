                 <strong>Risk Minimization:</strong> Pezesha has deployed a robust credit scoring model, capable of processing conventional and unconventional data in order to identify credible low income borrowers. The ability to identify these credible borrowers who typically do not have any collateral helps to minimize the risk that lenders on our platform stand to face.
                 <br>

                <strong>Maximization of Returns:</strong> Pezesha is structured in a way whereby the lenders receive their full income without incurring any operating costs which are involved in facilitating the loans. This is achievable because Pezesha uses a peer to peer structure thereby ensuring that lenders get maximum returns which pezeshasha deals with the basic expenses

That said, it is our job at Pezesha to make sure that we stringently assess all borrowers before they are eligible for loans, this ensures repayment, which in turn ensures stable investor returns. We advocate for a prudent risk policy that involves:<br>
                <strong>Pre-screening:</strong> Before on-boarding a borrower, we conduct thorough checks to determine their capacity to pay. Using our credit-scoring model, we establish the borrower’s credit score and reference third party information from Credit Reference Bureaus.<br>
                <strong>Diversification:</strong>  We put your eggs in many baskets!!! The Pezesha platform spreads your risk by lending your funds across multiple borrowers<br>

                Consumer protection is at the heart of our business for both our borrowers and lenders. With the expertise of our legal arm, we have been able to set clear terms and conditions for our customers including complying with the best international practices over and above that which is required by Kenyan law. We take a collaborative approach in educating our customers on our terms of use and ensuring good user experience in presenting and communicating the terms on our platform.<br>
                Our customer KYC process is thorough with checks and balances including checking with third parties credit databases for any fraud or illegal track record. We do this in a number of ways:<br>
                1.Education<br>
                We understand that the character of a borrower is a key factor in whether the borrower will meet his/her loan obligation. To this end, we spend considerable time in educating the borrower as a means of positively influencing the borrower’s character.<br>
                Therefore, our loan process starts with educating and creating self-financial awareness to the low income borrowers. This is followed by a clear explanation of the terms and conditions of the loan and how the ability of the borrower to diligently abide by the terms such as timely repayments, helps to improve their credit history performance to ultimately connect them to becoming part of the formal financial system.<br>
                Additionally, this education helps us to build a loyal relationship with our customers and understand their needs better. The credit we facilitate is built on responsible financing - transparency and trust to the lenders by giving them sufficient information about the borrowers’ risk profiles and use of funds.<br>
                We have closely followed guidelines by FSD Kenya on to how to ensure high levels of consumer protection in what we do.<br>
                Importantly, time is taken to explain what the Credit Reference Bureau (CRB) is, and to introduce them to the concept and consequences of “blacklisting”.<br>
                We explain the Terms & Conditions in a language conversant to the borrowers, and also advise the borrowers on how to contact Pezesha directly with any enquiries/ uncertainties<br>
                In summary, we ensure that the borrowers understand the terms of the loan agreement before proceeding to the loan application process. This includes understanding:<br>
                the foreseeability of harm or consequences including blacklisting if they fail to repay the loan on time;
                the use of the loan in line with moral and ethical principles
                the extent of the burden and consequences if the other members in their group or community do not pay back on time.
                the cost, availability and risks involved.<br>
                Borrower profiling<br>
                Importantly, our goal is to be sustainable in the long term, and we know that this will only be possible by ensuring that most of our borrowers have the capacity to pay back the micro loans they are given.<br>
                Our profiling helps us to understand the borrowers better and as such, we take guardianship seriously, and are careful not to overextend the amount of credit to an individual until the borrower has proven that they have the ability to generate the necessary payments and thus not fall into a debt trap.<br>
                This is governed by our duty of care that involves the signing of a legally binding contract and a digital consent acceptance form on our terms with each borrower.

               Our credit scoring continues to evolve to ensure its robust enough to further intelligently  assess creditworthy borrowers and automatically reject the ones below the threshold. This will significantly reduce default risk and increase returns for lenders.<br>
               Our credit scoring model helps us to identify borrowers at risk of overextending their debt by spotting irregular patterns in the data obtained from the borrowers. This is done through some complex data analytics which has taken into context the Kenyan financial environment,  and this is a core tenant of our credit scoring model.<br>
               Our team has built successful credit scoring models in Africa before. Our exceptionally talented tech team has built the scoring system to scale with our growth and allow us to closely monitor the performance of our loans. This allows us to better assess our new borrowers in order to tailor our offering to them, and allow lenders to choose a risk portfolio which best suits them.

               Yes. Pezesha investments covers 20% to 40% of the total loans granted on our platform. Our investment strengthens our  “skin in the game” in understanding and learning from our own data, risks and consumer behaviour, as well as patterns to reduce the risk of bad debts.<br>
               Pezesha will continue to invest alongside other lenders on the platform as this also helps us to maximize our returns in the short and long term. We walk the talk: Pezesha invests its own money on the platform to also demonstrate our confidence in our credit scoring model and also to gauge borrower behavior in terms of repayment and default so as to further enhance our credit scoring model.

               We have implemented an effective recovery policy: We make the best effort to recover lenders’ investment.<br>
               We send frequent SMS reminders and calls to borrowers on their loan repayment schedule - from day 1 to day 30. If they are late, we send them automated follow up SMS reminders. Furthermore, we work closely with community champions to assist in the collection process. We then do a follow up call and SMS in the event a borrower defaults on their repayment.<br>
               Thereafter, Pezesha forwards their names and details to a credit reference bureau, TransUnion, that doubles up as our external debt collection agency for blacklisting after day 90.<br>
               We ensure the external collection agency practices align with our values, approach and reporting policies through our monthly reviews and weekly communication and reporting. This is achieved through brainstorming cost effective and fair sanctions that include but not limited to giving the borrowers choices of restructuring their debt while ensuring that they are not incentivized to restructure when they could otherwise repay on time. After day 120, we then write off the loan.<br>
               In the event that a repayment goes past its term, the borrower incurs daily charges to encourage them to quickly settle their balance. The penalty interest will be included in the investor’s return.

               When funds are committed to a loan that has been disbursed, the money is with the borrower and cannot be reclaimed until it is repaid. When the borrower begins making repayments, these earnings are transferred back to your Pezesha account. Once the funds are in your Pezesha account, you can withdraw the funds at your convenience though we encourage you to re-invest to maximize your long-term returns.

                The lending balance is the same as your wallet balance and is the amount which is available for withdrawal at any point in time.<br>
                However, the funding balance is the amount which can be utilized for granting out loans.Typically, both lending balance and funding balance show the same figure for lenders who loan continuously from both interest earned and principal repaid<br>.
                These two balances will only be different if a lender chooses to lend out from only principal repayments. In this case, the funding balance will be lesser than the lending balance.

               As from the month of June 2017, Pezesha started deducting 15% Withholding Tax for all interest earned by lenders on our platform. This includes all interest on penalties accrued from late borrowers. This is a mandatory requirement by law under paragraph 5 of the third schedule of the income Tax Act. Lenders Wallet balance will be less WHT deductions. You can now see all the WHT from your dashboard on the app and when you click on it you will see the fine details of all loans and their deductions accordingly.
